# 🌟 JavaScript Learning Projects

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of small projects I'm building as I learn JavaScript. Each folder includes its own mini-project, source code, and a README file explaining what it does.

## 📁 Projects

- [📱 iPhone Calculator](./Calculator) – A replica of the iOS calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

More projects coming soon!

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks at first).
- Improve my front-end skills.
- Build a portfolio I can be proud of.

Stay tuned for more!
